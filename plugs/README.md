# booger plugs

a plugin system for booger

### ðŸš¨ breaking changes incoming

i'm changing the code a lot in a backwards incompatible way

# why

booger's core attempts to provide things that all relays want. Booger plugs are
a way to define custom behavior like rate limits and special validation rules.

There are a handful of things a booger operator might want to plugin to:

1. connections/disconnections, eg
   - preventing too many connections from a single IP address
   - only allowing whitelisted ips
2. subscription opens/closes, eg
   - preventing too many subscriptions from a single IP address
   - validating subscriptions with special rules
3. subscription eose, eg
   - collecting stats on event count and time to eose
4. event acceptance, eg
   - preventing duplicate messages within a certain time frame
   - preventing certain types of content
   - preventing blacklisted pubkeys
   - payments
   - validating events with special rules
   - adding support for NIPs that booger doesn't support (requires tbd
     enhancements)
5. notice and error messages

# how

You can plugin to these actions by adding one or more
[Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)
to the `./plugs` directory.

On startup, booger will recursively walk `./plugs` looking for `.js` and `.ts`
files. It will load and then send workers a `'getactions'` string message.
Workers must respond with an array containing one or more of the following
action strings:

1. `'connect'`
2. `'disconnect'`
3. `'sub'`
4. `'unsub'`
5. `'eose'`
6. `'event'`
7. `'notice'`
8. `'error'`

When an action occurs, workers who have registered for that action will get a
message from booger in the form:

```jsonc
{
   conn: {
      id: UUID // unique id to this connection
      headers: Object // http headers as a json object
   },
   action: String, // e.g. 'connect'
   data: Object // depends on the action and are documented further down
}
```

For the following action messages, booger plugs must respond indicating whether
or not booger should reject the action:

1. `'connect'`
2. `'sub'`
3. `'event'`

Responses from these actions must take the form:

```jsonc
{
   accept: Boolean, // true to accept, false if booger should prevent
   reason: String // reason for rejection if accept is false, undefined otherwise
   // TODO: we'll probably add a replyRaw to send replies directly to clients
}
```

The following actions cannot be rejected, so booger plugs should not respond to
them:

1. `'disconnect'`
2. `'unsub'`
3. `'eose'`
4. `'notice'`
5. `'error'`

# action data

Booger plugs will receive relevant action data in the `data` field of action
messages. This data varies depending on the action.

1. `'connect'`
   - `data` is `undefined`
2. `'disconnect'`
   - `data` is `undefined`
3. `'sub'`
   - ```jsonc
     data: {
        subId: String, // sub id as received from the client
        filters: [Filter] // array of filters as received from the client
     }
     ```
4. `'unsub'`
   - `data` is `undefined`
5. `'eose'`
   - ```jsonc
     data: {
        subId: String, // sub id as received from the client
        count: Integer // the number of events sent to the client before eose
     }
     ```
6. `'event'`
   - ```jsonc
     data: {
        event: Event, // event as received from the client
     }
     ```
7. `'notice'`
   - ```jsonc
     data: {
        notice: String, // the notice message sent to the client
     }
     ```
8. `'error'`
   - ```jsonc
     data: {
        error: Object, // the Error object as a json object
     }
     ```

# toy examples

## reject kind 6 events

```js
self.onmessage = ({ data }) => {
  if (data === 'getactions') {
    self.postMessage(['event'])
    return
  }

  if (data.action === 'event' && data.data.event.kind === 6) {
    self.postMessage({ accept: false, reason: 'blocked: kind 6 not allowed' })
    return
  }

  self.postMessage({ accept: true })
}
```

## reject kind 6 events and subscriptions with > 100 filters

```js
self.onmessage = ({ data }) => {
  if (data === 'getactions') {
    self.postMessage(['event', 'sub'])
    return
  }

  if (data.action === 'event' && data.data.event.kind === 6) {
    self.postMessage({ accept: false, reason: 'blocked: kind 6 not allowed' })
    return
  }

  if (data.action === 'sub' && data.data.filters.length > 100) {
    self.postMessage({
      accept: false,
      reason: 'blocked: >100 filters not allowed',
    })
    return
  }

  self.postMessage({ accept: true })
}
```

## log subscription times

```js
const timers = new Map()
self.onmessage = ({ data }) => {
  if (data === 'getactions') {
    self.postMessage(['sub', 'unsub'])
    return
  }

  if (data.action === 'sub') {
    timers.set(data.data.subId, Date.now())
    self.postMessage({ accept: true })
    return
  }

  if (data.action === 'unsub') {
    console.info(
      `sub ${data.data.subId} took: ${
        Date.now() - timers.get(data.data.subId)
      }ms`,
    )
    timers.delete(data.data.subId)
    return
  }
}
```

# builtin

The following plugs are bundled into booger implicitly.

1. validation
   - [events](/plugs/builtin/validate/event.js)
   - [subscriptions](/plugs/builtin/validate/sub.js)
2. [stats](/plugs/builtin/stats/stats.js) stores connection and subscription
   statistics
3. [limits](/plugs/builtin/limits/limits.js) provides some basic rate limiting

When running booger executables you can prevent these plugs from being used by
removing them from `./booger.jsonc`.

You can configure these plugs from `./booger.jsonc`.

# ignoring files in `/plugs`

If you want to put `.js` or `.ts` files in `/plugs` that aren't workers or that
you want ignored, you can specify them in a `.plugsignore` file. The intent is
to support a `.gitignore` like syntax.
