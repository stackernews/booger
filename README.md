# booger

A nostr relay

### üö® breaking changes incoming

the code is slowly stabalizing but i'm still changing the code in a backwards
incompatible way ... this probably isn't ready for prod yet either (until I run
it in prod more myself)

# what booger does

- supports many NIPs: 1, 2, 4, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20, 26, 28, 33, 40
- suitable for horizontally scaling websocket layer with a load balancer
- pluggable: connections, disconnections, subs, sub closes, events, eoses,
  notices, and errors
  - [read more about booger plugs](/plugs/README.md)
- compiles into a single, secure executable
  - each release will probably contain two executables with different
    permissions:
    1. normal - the same crazy unrestricted permissions you run most things on
       your computer with
    2. hardened - a very restricted executable
       - only communicates on loopback
       - only able access relevant environment variables
       - only able to write to `./booger.jsonc`
       - only able to read from `./booger.jsonc` and `./plugs/`
       - [read more about booger's runtime security on deno.land](https://deno.com/manual@v1.34.2/basics/permissions)
- rate limits (very basic ones atm)
- collects stats on connections and subscriptions for analysis

# what booger doesn't do (yet)

- elaborate defenses: spam filtering, payments
  - these are probably best provided as [booger plugs](/plugs/README.md)
- use postgres read replicas
- use postgres partitions

# what booger wants

simplicity, ease of use, extensibility, scalability, performance, security

# booger in words

- deno serves websockets
- filters are stored in a sqlite in-memory database and mapped to a websocket
- events are persisted in postgres
- when an event is persisted (or an ephemeral event is received) a postgres
  `NOTIFY event, <event json>` is broadcast
- all booger processes in the cluster `LISTEN event` and when notified check
  sqlite for matching filters and send to corresponding websockets

# how to run (locally)

0. [install postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and run it (welcome
   to app programming)
1. insall deno 1.34.2 or later (welcome to deno)
   - [ways to install deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno_install)
   - or just run `curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh -s v1.34.2`
   - üö®
     [earlier versions of deno might not play well with booger](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/17283)
   - [read more about deno on deno.land](https://deno.land/)
2. clone booger (this step & step 3 won't be necessary when we start issuing
   releases)
   - `git clone git@github.com:stackernews/booger.git && cd booger`
   - or `git clone https://github.com/stackernews/booger.git && cd booger`
3. run `deno task compile` to generate an executable booger ü•∏
   - to produce a hardened executable run `deno task compile-harden` instead
4. run `./booger` and your own nostr relay is listening on `127.0.0.1:8006`

# how to configure

## via `booger.jsonc`

---

The easiest way to configure booger is through the `./booger.jsonc` file. Run
`./booger --init` to generate a `./booger.jsonc` containing booger's defaults.
`./booger.jsonc` contains _**all**_ of booger's configuration options.

## via `env`

---

The following `env` vars are used by booger and take precendence over any
provided in `./booger.jsonc`

| name        | booger.jsonc name |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| `BIND`      | bind              |
| `PORT`      | port              |
| `DB`        | db                |
| `DB_STATS`  | dbStats           |
| `DB_LIMITS` | dbLimits          |

_reminder: all of the default values are documented in the `./booger.jsonc` file
generated by running `./booger --init`_

## via cli

---

Configuration values passed via cli take precedence over those in `env` or
`./booger.jsonc`

# how to plugin (aka booger plugs)

booger's core attempts to provide things that all relays want. Booger plugs are
a way for booger operators to define custom behavior like rate limits, special
validation rules, logging, and what not via
[Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API).

booger's validation, stat collector, and rate limiting are all implemented as
booger plugs. [Read more about booger plugs](/plugs/README.md).

# how to compile with different permissions

If you try to access things that a hardened booger executable isn't permitted to
access (like a remote postgres or a `booger.jsonc` not in pwd), deno's runtime
will prompt you to access them. If you'd like to avoid deno's prompts, you'll
need to compile booger with different permissions.

You can view the `deno compile` command we use to compile booger in
[deno.jsonc](/deno.jsonc) and modify it to your liking.
[Read more about deno's permissions](https://deno.com/manual@v1.34.2/basics/permissions).
